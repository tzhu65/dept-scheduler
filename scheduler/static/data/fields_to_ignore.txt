Will you be returning in Fall? (because I will just delete students who aren’t, or set their hours to 0. )
Do you expect to be fully supported as a research assistant for the entire academic year next year?
If you answered yes to the previous question, please give the name of the professor who will be supporting you.
Pure or Applied?
Based on the above description of TA hours and assignments, how many hours, if any, do you expect to be BOUGHT OUT of in Fall 2018? (probably you can ignore this and I can make a column that says how many hours the student actually has available) — let me know what you want me to call this column that gives actual hours.
If you will be bought out of any Fall hours, what is the name of the professor who will be supporting you?
