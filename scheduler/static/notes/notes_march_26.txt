•	Fall is more flexible than the spring, spring hours are dependent on the fall Ex: Fall given 12 hours->Spring 18 hours assigned

Teach 12
Assistant 6
Lab 6
Recitation 3

Multiple assistants for ea. course possible

Check for hours

When people assigned to reception
Better not to assign them to multiple recitations to multiple teachers
•	Preferably
⁃	Same professor If possible
⁃	Same course recitation if possible

Possibly throw flag if someone has over 18 hours?


Output file from website

First year students aren’t on list, but only have 10 hours available
First year students can only do assisting and math help center (In the fall)->Spring can do anything

If they are gonna be fully bought out for the semester -> ignore  (12/6/18), just parse out the number
